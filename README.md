## Explanation:
- Random Number Generation: The Random class generates a number between 1 and 100.

# Project: Student Information System with 

Data Structures (Intermediate Project)

## Project Description:
- This is a Student Information System where student details are stored, and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are performed using OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and DSA (Data Structures) concepts. The data is stored in a custom LinkedList structure and performs searching using Binary Search Trees (BST) for efficient data retrieval.

- This project demonstrates both OOP principles and DSA concepts, which can be added to your resume. The project features the following:

- OOP Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
- DSA Concepts: Linked List, Binary Search Tree (BST), Searching and Sorting.
